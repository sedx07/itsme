      Hi, I’m Sedef Sert — a Computer Engineering graduate and MSc candidate passionate about building impactful software solutions.
I have hands-on experience in Python, JavaScript, C#, ABAP, SQL/T-SQL, Django, and React, and I enjoy turning ideas into working applications.

Over the years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from AI-powered applications and automated workflows to integrated reporting platforms with Power BI.
My goal is to keep improving my technical skills while contributing to projects that solve real-world problems.
